# Hello_World
New self-taught coder looking to learn new languages
I am a college graduate with a double major in Mathematics and Physcs.
I am interested in learning more about the IT world.
Currently am learning how to write code to run in Python.
I am using the scripting program Atom to write my codes and have covered the following topics:
  Printing
  String formats
  Using the built in function "argv" to allow user to imput different variables and files
  Similarly using the "raw_input" function to allow user to input text while code is running
  Opening, reading, writing, and copying to files 
  Defining functions
  While loops
  If-Else statements
 
I am still very new to all this (only been coding for about 3 weeks) but am enjoying it very much

If anyone actually happens to read this, I am open to any helpful comments and tips
